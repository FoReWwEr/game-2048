# Base Layout Template

# Project Description
This project is a base layout template for the "2048" game, developed using modern tools and technologies to ensure efficient development and maintenance. The primary technologies used in the project include HTML for page structure, JavaScript for game logic, SCSS for styling, and Stylelint for code quality checking.

# Technologies
1) HTML: A markup language used for creating the structure and content of web pages.
2) JavaScript: A programming language used to implement the game logic and interactivity.
3) SCSS (Sass): A CSS preprocessor that allows the use of variables, nested rules, mixins, functions, and other features for more convenient and efficient styling.
4) Stylelint: A tool for analyzing and checking CSS/SCSS code for compliance with standards and rules, helping to maintain clean and quality code.
